# customer-churn-prediction



📜 Introduction
Customer Churn Prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to stop using their services. By using a Random Forest Classifier, this project predicts churn based on customer behavior and demographics.

This repository contains the complete implementation, from data preprocessing to visualizing key features influencing churn.

🛠️ Features
Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing data.
Encodes categorical variables using dummy encoding.
Machine Learning:
Trains a Random Forest model for churn prediction.
Visualizations:
Confusion matrix for model evaluation.
Feature importance plot for insights into the model.
